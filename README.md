This application allows the user to do x, y, and z. Maybe here's a reason why I wanted to do this project, or
came up with this idea.

### User Stories
As a user, I want to create an account and be able to login in As a user, I want to be able to play the game and reset the game as I wish As a user, I want to see the number of games played I have As a user, I want to be able to reset my password As a user, I want to be able to secure the log out of the website.

### Planning Story
The user will have to create an account to get access to the game, once the user is log in, he will receive options on the page, such as to play the game, start a new game and reset, change password and logout.

### Technologies Used

### Unsolved Problems

- Still need to fix sign out.
